##A simple top down shooter with a field of view

###Build instructions

I have only tested it on Linux so far. To build it from source you will need [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php), [Box2D](http://box2d.org/) and make. Both are available in a package on Ubuntu.

###Build instructions for Ubuntu

First move to the directory where you've downloaded the project. To do this execute:  
`cd /Path/To/The/Project/`

`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev libbox2d-dev`  
`make`

To run the game:
`./topDownShooter`

###Controls
- Use wasd or the arrow keys to move
- Right click to aim

###Maps

Maps are written in the pgm format where a brightness of 255 or 1 is a wall and a brightness of 0 is normal ground. There can't be any comments in the pgm file and it has to ASCII encoded. You can edit pgm files with most popular image editors, like GIMP. An minimap will automatically be generated by the game. For the best performance, walls should only be one tile thick.

###Light maps

Positions of the lights are saved in a seperate bitmap of te PPM type. This bitmap should be as big as the part of the map from the top left of the map where you want to have lights. Black in this bitmap indicates a tile without a light. Any other color indicates a light of that color.
