A simple top down shooter with a field of view

Maps are written in the pgm format where a brightness of 255 or 1 is a wall and a brightness of 0 is normal ground. There can't be any comments in the pgm file and it has to ASCII encoded. You can edit pgm files with most popular image editors, like GIMP. An minimap will automatically be generated by the game. For the best performance, walls should only be one tile thick.
